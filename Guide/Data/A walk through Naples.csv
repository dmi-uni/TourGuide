0;Chiostro di Santa Chiara ;One of the best places to escape from the speed and noise of the city is inside the Santa Chiara monastery complex. Gothic-style religious complex features a church, monastery & museum. Santa Chiara is most famous for its elaborately decorated cloisters. The complex was built between 1313-1340 so the oldest features date back to the 14th century. The church is free to enter but it is also worth the €6 ticket fee to explore the cloisters. The unique beauty of Santa Chiara is here, outside, among the painted tiles. ;40.8459733;14.2531544;Chiostro di Santa Chiara, Via Santa Chiara, 49/C, 80134 Napoli NA, Italy;

2;Napoli Sotterranea;You can hardly turn over a spade of soil in any Italian city without uncovering centuries of history, and Naples is no exception.

The underground city spreads below the entire old town, its myths and legends are still alive in the imagination of all the Neapolitans.;40.83729700000001;14.245562;Vico S.
