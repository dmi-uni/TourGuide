Made in Naples;Though Milan and Florence considered the fashion capitals of Italy, Naples is also a center of excellence — one with a long legacy in tailoring and producing legendary accessories. It was the Bourbon dynasty, which ruled Naples from 1734 to 1861, which encouraged local artisanal production and ushered in a period of enlightenment for the city. Today, historic workshops still exist alongside contemporary boutiques that sell hand-stitched handbags, printed silk accessories, ceramic tiles and more.
